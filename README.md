# Responsive-Modules-Dropdown-Modal
Well thats exactly what it is :  Sleek modules with attached modals &amp; custom scrollbar  .

Modal scrolls to appropriate window location, caluculated using 'scrollTop()'.
Modules resize based on screen dimensions.

Super-lightweight, can be used without including jQuery.
